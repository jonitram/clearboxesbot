# Pokemon Box Clearing Bot

As long as the in-game preconditions are met before plugging in the device, plugging the Arduino directly into the switch through a USB Type B to USB Type C cable should enable the bot to start deleting entire boxes of pokemon moving right depending on the number of boxes specified

## In-Game Information

### Preconditions

- You are not in any menus
- You are in a location where you can access the PC Box Link
- Ensure that when you hit "X" the cursor is on the "Pokemon" icon
- Ensure that when you activate the PC Box Link from your party, the box it opens up to is the first box you are looking to clear and any subsequent boxes you would like to clear are to the right of it
- Ensure that the number of boxes you have specified to delete are completely filled with pokemon (without any eggs)

## Setting up the Arduino

- Disclaimer: These instructions were written for Mac OSX in the context of an Arduino with an atmega16u2 chip
- Change the `total_boxes` variable to the number of boxes you would like cleared at the top of `instructions.h` before making and flashing `Joystick.hex` to the Arduino

### Dependencies and Compiling

- Install dfu-programmer through homebrew with:

    `brew install dfu-programmer`
- To compile this project you need AVR GCC Compiler and Tools. This can be installed through homebrew with:

    `brew tap osx-cross/avr`

    followed by

    `brew install avr-gcc`
- Download the LUFA library through this [link](http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php) and put it in this directory
- Make sure the `LUFA_PATH` inside the `makefile` points to the LUFA subdirectory that you just created inside this directory
- Ensure that the `makefile` setting for `MCU` is set to `MCU = atmega16u2` and compile by typing `make`

### Putting the Arduino in DFU Mode

- Plug the Arduino into a computer
- Put the Arduino in DFU mode if it is not already by bridging the reset pin with the ground
- If necessary, ensure the Arduino is in DFU mode by typing:

    `sudo dfu-programmer atmega16u2 get ID1`

### Flashing onto the Arduino

- Navigate to the folder containing the `.hex` file you are flashing onto the Arduino
- In this case, the `.hex` file to be flashed onto the Arduino is called `Joystick.hex` generated by the `makefile`
- Follow these commands to flash the `.hex` file:

    `sudo dfu-programmer atmega16u2 erase`

    `sudo dfu-programmer atmega16u2 flash <.hex file>`

    `sudo dfu-programmer atmega16u2 reset`

- If you receive this error:

    `dfu-programmer: no device present.`

    but your Arduino is plugged in and the lights are on then you most likely need to put the Arduino into DFU mode by bridging its reset and ground pins
